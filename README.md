# dec-to-bin
Decimal to Binary Converter - Python
This "DecimalToBinary.py" was the original file I created long ago
The "DecimalToBinaryv2.0.py" is the revised and rewritten method of conversion
    - this version takes less time to compute; however, it can now only compute digits between 0 and 1*10^40
